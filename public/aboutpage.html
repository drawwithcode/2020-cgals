    <span class="details">Memorypedia</span> is a collaborative web experience about collective and personal memory, where <br>with a simple and instant interaction, users can contribute to a continuously growing visual narration <br>of words and images.
   </p>
   <p>
     <span class="details2">(1) </span>SPECULATION — The name of the project comes from the semiotic concept of “encyclopaedia” identified <br>by  <span class="details2">Umberto Eco</span> as the common array of all the knowledge and experiences shared by a group. <br> This common ground allows the comprehension of a message and if the speaker and the recipient do not <br>share the same encyclopedia, the message might be misinterpreted.<br> This concept reflects on how communication is based on personal background and has an evocative <br>power that enables meanings that are not literal but come from the recipient or viewer’s personal experience. <br>The idea underlying the app is to play on this differences of interpretation.
   </p>
   <p>
     <span class="details2">(2) </span>AIM — The huge amount of information provided bt the Internet encourages forgetting rather than remembering. <br>Creating a web app that reflects on memory could be seen as a provocative work with the aim of raising <br>awareness of the problem of how technology affects our capability of remembering.
   </p>

    <p>
      <span class="details2">(3) </span>CONTEXT — A universitary project designed as a collaborative experience for sponsoring events related <br> to memory and communication, such as the Italian <span class="details2">Festival della Memoria</span>.
     </p>
     <!-- <p style="margin-top: 2.5em;">
   <span class="title">Memorypedia</span>
 </p> -->
 <p>
<span class="details2">(4) </span>PROCESS — The digital platform allows participants to take part in the experience anywhere, anytime. <br>By continuing the chain where it was left off, participants are able to collaborate with the rest of the world.
<p/>
<p>
<span class="details2">(5) </span> OUTPUT — Memorypedia revisits a simple parlour game focusing on the psychology concept of involuntary <br>memory, that is our capability of creating links between different worlds by referring to our own experience.<br>The result is a chain of words and pictures, generated by all the contributions coming together.
